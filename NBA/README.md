# Project Overview

In this project, I'll try to predict who will win basketball games in the NBA.  We'll start by web scraping NBA box scores from www.basketball-reference.com. We'll read in and clean the html using BeautifulSoup.  Then we'll parse the box scores into pandas DataFrames that we can use.  Then we'll do feature selection to identify good predictors, and train a machine learning model to make predictions.  We'll end by computing rolling predictors and improving the model.

This is a complete project, and we'll be using web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning.
